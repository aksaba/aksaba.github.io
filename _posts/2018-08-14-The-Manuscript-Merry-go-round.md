### The Manuscript Merry-go-round

The most satisfying as well as, in my opinion at least, the most important part of the work of a scientist or a researcher is to share the results of the research conducted. It is the most satisfying because of the amount of time and effort one has put in to the work with the belief that the end result would make a contribution, however minuscule it may seem, to the scientific body of knowledge. It is the most important because the work is now open to be read, understood, criticized and improved by the academia of the word. However, for young researchers like myself, publishing research is increasingly accompanied by a feeling of relief rather than satisfaction while the process itself starting from manuscript preparation to final acceptance of the revised paper is dotted with moments filled with varying degrees of emotions - mild annoyance to tragicomedy.  

I write this on the day when I have gone through the manuscript publication process the third time in two weeks. On both the two previous occasions, the editor of the respective journals reasoned that the presented work was beyond the scope of the journal which I accept. The idea of relevance ranges over a degree. Let's say my work is relevant to two different journals - say journal X and journal Y. Journal Y has a better impact factor and more importantly has a faster review speed on average that journal X. Now, even though my work is a little more relevant to journal Y, I would at least have a go at journal X hoping I would get lucky. But I have not been so lucky on the first two occasions. The editor of the second journal was more considerate and replied with a link to transfer the manuscript to the journal (third attempt). Yet, we had to fulfill the specific conditions of the third journal before approving the submission.

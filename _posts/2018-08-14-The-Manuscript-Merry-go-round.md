<p>The most satisfying as well as, in my opinion at least, the most important part of the work of a scientist or a researcher is to share the results of the research conducted. It is so because of the amount of time and effort one has put in to the work with the belief that the end result would make a contribution, however minuscule it may seem, to the scientific body of knowledge which is now open (somewhat restrictively, maybe) to be read, understood, criticized, used and improved by the academia of the world. However, for young researchers like myself, publishing research is increasingly accompanied by a feeling of relief rather than satisfaction while the process itself starting from manuscript preparation to final acceptance of the revised paper is dotted with moments filled with a range of emotions - mild annoyance to tragicomedy.  </p><br>

<p>I write this on the day when I have gone through the manuscript publication process the third time in two weeks. On both the two previous occasions, the editor of the respective journals reasoned that the presented work was beyond the scope of the journal which I am inclined to accept. The idea of relevance can be of varying degrees. Let's say my work is relevant to two different journals - say journal X and journal Y. Journal Y has a better impact factor and more importantly has a faster review speed on average that journal X. Now, even though my work is a little more relevant to journal Y, I would at least have a go at journal X hoping I would get lucky. But I have not been so lucky on the first two occasions. The editor of the second journal was more considerate and replied with a link to transfer the manuscript to another journal (the third one). Yet, we had to fulfill the specific conditions of the third journal before approving the submission.  </p> <br>

<p>As we wait for the reply from the editor of the third journal, both myself and my supervisor were struck with a question: What if this editor also declines and suggests the name of the first journal as being more relevant? Although comical at first, the thought of my manuscript being stuck in some kind of editorial time loop is a little disconcerting. I have read about the turbulent times when young Darwin hesitated publishing his groundbreaking theory of evolution fearing the repercussions of challenging the dogmatic ideas of the Church. Well, today, my work is neither groundbreaking nor am I nowhere near prodigious as Darwin and yet I fear publishing my work because of the dreaded review process. Hopefully, my manuscript will not be burnt to ashes because I exceeded the preferred length of the double line spaced template by a few pages.   </p>

<div style="text-align:justify">

<p>There was a flash fiction contest at IIT Madras organised by the writing club. I'm not much of a fiction writer, I have to admit but I thought I give it a go. Selected entries were to make it to the following month's e-magazine put together by the club. Unfortunately, my entry did not make the cut. So, I'm going to share it here instead.  </p><br>

<p> We were given a list of writing prompts. I chose, "An unexpected delivery". A microfiction is usually about 300 words long. In this contest, there was an additional challenge of 100 words or less. I decided to take up this challenge just for the fun of it. Here is my attempt which has exactly 100 words:    </p> <br>

<blockquote><i>

<p>Ramesh hesitantly pushed the door ajar and peeked outside. He noticed a familiar face at the end of the dimly lit corridor. With the heavy bag emblazoned with the word "ekart" swinging left and right, a young man came running towards him. All day, Ramesh had been pacing about next to the rickety bed despite his illness that kept him in isolation. The delivery was expected at any time and Ramesh was in the wrong room.</p>

<p>
    "So, uhâ€¦ what...", quivered Ramesh in nervous excitement.
</p>
<p>
"Congrats anna, you are a father of twins!", replied the young man still panting and smiling.   </p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>
Some additional info: "ekart" is a logistics company. Young men working for the company burdened with a heavy bag full of packages to be delivered and going around in two-wheelers are a familiar sight in Indian roads. "Anna" means elder brother in Tamil language.

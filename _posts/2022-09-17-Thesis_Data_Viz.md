I've some interest in creating data visualizations that are both aesthetically pleasing and effective in communicating the author's intended idea. My PhD program provided ample opportunity to create such visualizations to depict some of the research themes related to my work. In this post, I thought I'd post these visualizations. I created these visualizations in the open-source data plotting software, Veusz. Veusz is an excellent and useful software with a wide variety of formatting options. I had acknowledged the software in my thesis as well.

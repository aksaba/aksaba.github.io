I've some interest in creating data visualizations that are both aesthetically pleasing and effective in communicating the author's intended idea. My PhD program provided ample opportunity to create such visualizations to depict some of the research themes related to my work. In this post, I thought I'd post these visualizations. I created these visualizations in the open-source data plotting software, Veusz. Veusz is an excellent and useful software with a wide variety of formatting options. I had acknowledged the software in my thesis as well.

###  A simple bar plot with background images

This is a simple bar plot showing the number of papers published in relation to the research conducted on building insulation materials based on different types of agricultural residue. To make this rather simple visualization is little more attractive, I made the bars wider and included images of the agricultural residues as background. 

###  Values of a single variable selected by authors

All of the more creative visualizations that I had done were for the literature review chapter. This one shows the values of density of a building insulation material (straw in this case) selected by various researchers over the years. I made the markers into big boxes, which are either shaded or transparent to show that the values are continuous or discrete, respectively, so that the plot is distinct and attracts the attention of the reader.

###  Showcasing variation in multiple variables

The visualization on which I put the most time and effort is this one. It is a diagrammatic summary of a major portion of the literature review covering the ranges or types of different characteristics of straw insulation that have been selected by authors over the years. The first one is a gray-scale version I made for the thesis, and the second one is the colorized version I made for my paper. The different ways you can differentiate the characteristics are by changing the shape of the marker, using different colors or a color gradient, changing the size of the marker, and using shaded or transparent markers. In this plot, I used a gray-scale gradient or rainbow color gradient to show the variation in density, different shapes of markers to indicate the orientation of straw arrangement, and discrete markers and bars to show individual and ranged values, respectively, all the while the timeline of the research in straw insulation is the subject of the primary X-Y plot.

###  Scatter plot showing closely bunched values

This is a basic scatter plot, but the challenge was to make individual lines distinct since there were a number of similarly varying individual plots. I used different shapes and shadings to bring out the distinction. 

###  Visualizing instrumentation

This one does not communicate numerical data but rather information about location and type of sensors installed in a experimental setup. This particular schematic shows the locations of thermocouples and relative humidity sensors installed in test room. Different colors are used to differentiate the four walls and the roof of the room.

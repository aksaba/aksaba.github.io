I am currently working independently as a technical and language editor. Occasionally, I like to foray into various other activities, including research, reading and writing, data visualization, and coding, and this blog features some of the results of these activities. I'm also interested in CFD simulation (I've done some simulation work as part of my doctoral research), cooking (I've temporarily filled on several occasions in as a cooking assistant to my mother in the kitchen at home), philosophy (as we grow old, we are inclined to philosophize about life, death, and everything in between), and investment analysis (to make money earn more money, of course!).

I earned my PhD in 2020 from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM), Chennai, India. My topic of research is _Thermal Characterization of Straw and Evaluation of Thermal Performance of Concrete-Straw-Plaster Building Envelope for Different Climatic Zones of India_. I authored, along with my supervisor at IITM, [four research papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LBHOxzAAAAAJ&hl=en) and I attended an [international conference in Incheon, South Korea](http://aksaba.github.io/#2016-12-04-03), during my doctoral program. Prior to that, I obtained my master's degree in Energy Engineering from the Institute of Energy Studies at the College of Engineering, Anna University, Chennai, India, and my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.

For the past two years, as a freelance editor, I've edited original research papers in mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering for [Cactus Communications](https://cactusglobal.com/) and copyedited books on various subjects, such as science, engineering, technology, economics, mathematics, and management, for [Academic Consultancy and Editorial Services](https://www.acesworldwide.net/), which is part of [World Scientific Publishing](https://worldscientific.com/). I have also done a fair bit of editing of research papers, theses, and reports for friends and acquaintances.

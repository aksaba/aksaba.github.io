# Hello! I'm Karthik.

####  This is my portfolio page, showcasing my different works, including writings, photos, and codes.

##### A little about meâ€¦

I'm currently working independently as a technical and
language editor. Occasionally, I like to foray into various other activities,
including research, reading and writing, data visualization, and coding, and
this blog features some of the results of these activities (check out the links on the left). I'm also interested
in CFD simulation (I've done some simulation work as part of my doctoral
research), cooking (I've temporarily filled in on several occasions as a cooking
assistant to my mother in the kitchen at home), philosophy (as we grow old, we
are inclined to philosophize about life, death, and everything in between), and
investment analysis (to make money earn more money, of course!).

I earned my PhD in 2020 from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM),
Chennai, India. My topic of research is *Thermal Characterization of Straw and Evaluation of Thermal Performance of Concrete-Straw-Plaster Building Envelope for Different Climatic Zones of India.*  I authored, under the guidance of my PhD supervisor at IITM, [four research papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LBHOxzAAAAAJ&hl=en) and attended an international conference in Incheon, South Korea, during my doctoral program.  Prior to that, I obtained my master's degree in energy engineering from the Institute of Energy Studies at the College of Engineering, Anna University, Chennai, India, and my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.

For the past two years, as a freelance editor, I've edited original research papers
in mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering for  [Cactus Communications](https://cactusglobal.com/">Cactus Communications) and copyedited books on various subjects, such as science, engineering, technology, economics, mathematics, and management, for [Academic Consultancy and Editorial Services](https://www.acesworldwide.net/), which is part of  [World Scientific Publishing](https://worldscientific.com/). I have also done a fair bit of editing of research papers, theses, and reports

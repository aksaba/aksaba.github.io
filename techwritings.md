### Introduction Section of My Thesis

**Introduction**

Buildings are symbols marking the time of humans in Earth’s history. Humans have constructed all kinds of structures—monuments, fortresses, and skyscrapers—which have left and continue to leave enduring imprints on our planet’s landscape. Nonetheless, the modest house remains timeless, providing shelter and safety. In this chapter, after briefly touching up on the transformations in construction practices through history, particularly in housing, the emphasis shifts to the need for sustainability to go hand in hand with comfort in our future homes. The chapter is concluded with the motivations leading to the current work dealing with the thermal performance of buildings utilizing an eco-friendly material, straw, as a construction material.

**Home: A Brief Look at History**

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a “house,” in a general sense, as “a building that serves as living quarters for one or a few families” (Merriam-Webster.com dictionary, 2020). The idea of linking home to house could be seen as a byproduct of the transformations that our successive ancestors went through. Hunter-gatherers took shelter in natural formations, such as rocks and caves. These were their “homes.” The Neolithic age of history was marked by the proliferation of farming and domestication of animals, leading to humans increasingly settling in a location as opposed to having a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Earth-based materials were employed for the construction of all kinds of structures, including shelters. These shelters became houses and came to be identified as homes. In the Indian subcontinent, mud bricks were used in the construction of buildings in the early Indus Valley townships. Circular huts made of bamboo and thatch (as seen in Fig. 1.1) were uncovered during excavation of sites in Central and South India, such as Sangankallu and Tekkalkota (Mate, 1969).

With the rise of civilizations came new innovations leading to more resilient and rugged construction materials—brick, lime, and, eventually, cement and concrete (Venkatarama Reddy, 2009). Concrete was known to be used in ancient Rome (Moore, 1993). But a paradigm shift in construction technology occurred during the industrial revolution, enabling mass production of cement and concrete in Europe. The developing nations were not far behind in adopting these materials into their construction industries. Today, China and India are the world’s first- and second-largest producers of cement in the world, respectively (United States Geological Survey, 2014). The primary driver of cement demand in India is the residential construction sector. For the financial year 2016–2017, 67% of the total cement demand was contributed by housing (India Brand Equity Foundation, 2018). The versatility of cement and cement-based construction materials has made their use hugely popular and widespread. The two detrimental outcomes of the quick adoption of cement technology in India are (a) poor construction practices leading to unsustainability within the cement industry itself (Bhattacharjee, 2010) and (b) the near-complete abandonment of vernacular building concepts (Chandran et al., 2015).

**Thermal Comfort and Sustainability**

Human comfort has a multitude of aspects, one of which is thermal comfort. The idea of thermal comfort is intrinsically linked with the human experience to such an extent that the term “thermal comfort” is defined as a “condition of the mind” (ASHRAE, 2013). As concrete technology ensured that we live our lives more and more isolated from nature, the meteoric rise in the installation of space-conditioning equipment (International Energy Agency, 2018) almost convinced us that we may never need a natural environment. Furthermore, the increasing sophistication in space-conditioning technology meant that we soon possessed the controlling capacity to conjure and maintain “near-perfect” living conditions from a thermo-physical perspective. However, one could argue that the finer the control we, as humans, are able to exercise over our immediate environment, the narrower our perception of thermal comfort becomes. At the individual level, this feedback loop of control and perception gradually increases our intolerance to even mild variabilities in climate parameters. A similar sentiment was expressed by Stern (1992) when he stated that, “Cities create new addicts. By an ingenious positive feedback system, air-conditioning heats the outside air, creating demand for air-conditioning among people who did not want it before.” At the ecological level, the narrowing of our perceptions of thermal comfort translates into an increased carbon footprint owing to the implementation of energy-guzzling space-conditioning technologies. These vicious self-reinforcing loops, as illustrated in Fig. 1.2, at the individual and ecological levels could be even more dangerous in light of the severity of future weather events, which is one of the expected fallouts of climate change.

In the early 1920s, thermal comfort was seen as a rigid concept and was described in terms of fixed temperature and relative humidity values. Since then, with new studies, the boundaries of the acceptable temperature and humidity ranges for thermal comfort have expanded, and new metrics, such as the predicted mean vote (PMV) (Fanger, 1972) and bioclimatic charts (Manzano-Agugliaro et al., 2015), have come to represent thermal comfort in broader terms. However, more research is needed to gain a better understanding of thermal comfort, especially in non-air-conditioned buildings under various climatic conditions. An interesting and thorough discussion on the dynamics of comfort, energy, and the environment with emphasis on the individual was carried out by Mahdavi and Kumar (1996). The authors bring together different outlooks on the fundamental and complex question, “What constitutes thermal comfort?” One instance of the insightful discussion is that achieving thermal comfort through passive or passive-assisted means leads the user to perceive minor levels of discomfort in a neutral or even positive light, as opposed to the negative evaluation observed when thermal comfort is achieved through active means. It is important that decision-makers take into consideration such outlooks that deviate from the established norms if we are to reap the benefits of incorporating sustainable materials and building technologies into the future.

Maslow’s concept of hierarchal needs of humans can also be applied to homes in two ways, as shown in Fig. 1.3. In a time of ever-growing concerns about grievous consequences due to climate change, the second approach, in which comfort, sustainability, and functionality go hand in hand, should be the way forward in designing not just homes but also other types of buildings, such as offices and places of education. In this approach, functionality, which incorporates the growing home automation (e.g., Internet of Things) and energy conservation technologies, also plays a critical role in design and, therefore, is placed alongside sustainability and comfort in the pyramid. 

**Sustainable Construction Materials**

It is impossible to chart the future of sustainable thermal comfort in buildings without considering the effects of the two significant events that have irreversibly shaped the design and construction of modern buildings: concrete and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. The detrimental effects of the two on the environment are well documented by now (Watts, 2019; Buranyi, 2019). Their exponential growth needs to be checked through sustainable practices in building construction and utilization. Although research focus has recently skewed toward novel construction practices, such as the use of phase change materials (PCMs) (Saxena et al., 2019, 2020) and vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) (Alam et al., 2011), it is worthwhile to pursue research and development of construction materials derived from natural sources (Asdrubali et al., 2015) owing to their eco-friendliness and cost-effectiveness.

In the backdrop of rising concerns over the long-term effects of fossil fuel dependence,  several eco-friendly movements have emerged, one of which is the green-building movement. In the 1990s and 2000s, many countries established councils to oversee and implement green-building projects, culminating in the formation of the World Green Building Council (WGBC, 2020). Despite extensive media attention in India, there is a sparse preference for adopting green building ideas, as pointed out by Mani and Venkatarama Reddy (2012). Moreover, the authors raise concerns over laying greater emphasis on only the energy efficiency of a building rather than on the critical link between inhabitants and their living environment. The authors go on to discuss, with examples, the importance of sustainable design of buildings embracing vernacular concepts, especially in the transformation of rural India.

Throughout history, the climatic and cultural diversity of India necessitated the local population to devise and adopt materials and techniques, resulting in a rich plethora of vernacular construction methods. Therefore, it is worth looking back at our past when people employed passive methods of achieving indoor thermal comfort for possible reimagined solutions to today’s problems. For example, mud bricks reinforced with straw are one of the materials widely used in vernacular buildings all over India (Srivastava and Kumar, 2018; Singh et al., 2009).

**Motivation**

A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) titled “Global Warming of 1.5 ℃” (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2018) discusses the potential impacts of warming by 1.5 ℃ in the next 20 years and the preparatory steps needed to face the future in such a world. Coincidently, the report “The Future of Cooling” by OECD/IEA (International Energy Agency, 2018) estimates a dramatic rise in the demand for residential air-conditioning capacity in the same timeline. With the growing economy leading to an ever-expanding middle-income bracket combined with government initiatives, such as the “Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)” (Business Today, 2015), aimed at rapid housing and urbanization of small cities, towns, and villages, the situation poses a major challenge to India’s commitment toward a low-carbon future. This is a challenge that also provides us with the opportunity for research, development, and eventual commercialization of sustainable construction materials, such as those based on straw. In India, large swathes of straw are burnt on open grounds. This practice is one of the leading causes of widespread air pollution reaching toxic levels in the neighboring towns and cities (Jain et al., 2014). The issue of stubble burning is described in detail by Kumar et al. (2015), in which the authors, based on previous studies, note that around two-thirds to three-fourths of paddy residue is burnt. A spectroradiometric image (NASA, 2013) captured by NASA’s Aqua satellite on November 12, 2013, showed the locations of active burning of paddy stubble in North India. The importance of the need for alternative applications of straw cannot be overstated since it could potentially prove to be doubly beneficial—curbing the pollution caused by the burning of straw and utilizing an eco-friendly waste material. The fact that straw can be thermally insulating makes it a worthwhile effort to further investigate the use of straw as a construction material. Straw, as bales or processed and fabricated in the form of panels, can be used as the primary construction material. Moreover, retrofitting existing conventional buildings with straw insulation is another option worth exploring. As we have seen that the utilization of any construction material for homes is inextricably linked with the comfort and well-being of the inhabitants, the investigation of thermal comfort in straw-based buildings in the context of Indian climatic conditions is an essential step leading to the realization of such buildings in practice.


### Data Visualizations in My Thesis

I've some interest in creating data visualizations that are both aesthetically pleasing and effective in communicating the author's intended idea. My PhD program provided ample opportunity to create such visualizations to depict some of the research themes related to my work. In this post, I thought I'd post these visualizations. I created these visualizations in the open-source data plotting software, Veusz. Veusz is an excellent and useful software with a wide variety of formatting options. I had acknowledged the software in my thesis as well.

###  A simple bar plot with background images

This is a simple bar plot showing the number of papers published in relation to the research conducted on building insulation materials based on different types of agricultural residue. To make this rather simple visualization is little more attractive, I made the bars wider and included images of the agricultural residues as background. 

###  Values of a single variable selected by authors
<!-- ![17Sep_pic2.jpg (353×847) (raw.githubusercontent.com)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aksaba/aksaba.github.io/master/images/17Sep_pic2.jpg) -->

All of the more creative visualizations that I had done were for the literature review chapter. This one shows the values of density of a building insulation material (straw in this case) selected by various researchers over the years. I made the markers into big boxes, which are either shaded or transparent to show that the values are continuous or discrete, respectively, so that the plot is distinct and attracts the attention of the reader.

###  Showcasing variation in multiple variables
<!-- ![Image not found: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aksaba/aksaba.github.io/master/images/17Sep_pic3.jpg] --><!-- (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aksaba/aksaba.github.io/master/images/17Sep_pic3.jpg "Image not found: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aksaba/aksaba.github.io/master/images/17Sep_pic3.jpg")
![17Sep_pic4.jpg (1051×878) (raw.githubusercontent.com)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aksaba/aksaba.github.io/master/images/17Sep_pic4.jpg) -->
The visualization on which I put the most time and effort is this one. It is a diagrammatic summary of a major portion of the literature review covering the ranges or types of different characteristics of straw insulation that have been selected by authors over the years. The first one is a gray-scale version I made for the thesis, and the second one is the colorized version I made for my paper. The different ways you can differentiate the characteristics are by changing the shape of the marker, using different colors or a color gradient, changing the size of the marker, and using shaded or transparent markers. In this plot, I used a gray-scale gradient or rainbow color gradient to show the variation in density, different shapes of markers to indicate the orientation of straw arrangement, and discrete markers and bars to show individual and ranged values, respectively, all the while the timeline of the research in straw insulation is the subject of the primary X-Y plot.

###  Scatter plot showing closely bunched values
<!-- ![17Sep_pic5.jpg (840×581) (raw.githubusercontent.com)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aksaba/aksaba.github.io/master/images/17Sep_pic5.jpg) -->
This is a basic scatter plot, but the challenge was to make individual lines distinct since there were a number of similarly varying individual plots. I used different shapes and shadings to bring out the distinction. 

###  Visualizing instrumentation

This one does not communicate numerical data but rather information about location and type of sensors installed in a experimental setup. This particular schematic shows the locations of thermocouples and relative humidity sensors installed in test room. Different colors are used to differentiate the four walls and the roof of the room.
